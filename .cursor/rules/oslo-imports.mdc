# Oslo Import Rule

When using Oslo packages, always import from the explicit subpath, not the package root. This is required for compatibility with Vite and Node ESM resolution.

Example:
```js
// Correct:
import { Argon2id } from '@oslojs/crypto/argon2';

// Incorrect:
import { Argon2id } from '@oslojs/crypto';
```

Apply this rule for all Oslo package imports.
