# Svelte File Script Order Rule

In all Svelte files, the <script> block must appear before the HTML markup. This applies to every Svelte component in the codebase.

Example:
```svelte
<script>
  // JS/TS logic here
</script>

<!-- HTML markup here -->
```

Always follow this order when creating or editing Svelte files.
